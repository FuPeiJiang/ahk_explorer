ahk_explorer even if other folder still appears
, probably dual pane was being used and it was a download
, YES, correct, downloads on the right
, some othe on the left
, probably using ctrl shift right
, so the startWatch never stopped the left side
, and it never started the right side

so when I exit any, I'm gonna stop, and transfer it to the next one (if any)


I need to rewrite that logic..

case 1: 
    0 0
    X 0
    add(1, X)
case 2:
    X 0
    Y 0
    remove(X)
    add(1, Y)
case 3:
    X 0
    X 0
    do nothing
case 4:
    X 0
    X X
    do nothing
case 5:
    X 0
    X Y
    add(2, Y)
case 6: (will never happen) (lastDir%whichSide%!=EcurrentDir%whichSide%)
    X X
    X Y
    watch was on 1
    add(2, Y)
case 7:
    X X
    X Y
    watch was on 2
    remove(X)
    add(1, X)
    add(1, Y)
notice here, there are 2 add()

what if I had 3 panes ?
1. we always want to add watch
2. we do not add watch if already watched
    use a map to figure out if already
    watched
    diretory -> whichSide

1. we always want to remove watch
; 2. we do not remove watch if blank (this is taken care of by WatchFolder2.ahk)
3. we remove watch, and if there's another same, we add the watch back to that. so loop though every side.
using the map, we only remove watch if watch is on self pane.

bug name: when dual pane switch folder: watch folder watches wrong pane

f2 rename if typing is too fast, the renaming gui doesn't resize
maybe because it's being sent, and not because it's too fast..

send "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
using ahk

never use GuiControlGet again
always use ControlGetText

___

; capital letters are not recognized
; so PowerPoint, doesn't work
; the first letter is 'o'

1. search is case insensitive
2. I want more hotkeys (I can actually use Shift for hotkeys!)

___
when you click Name when 2nd pane has not been renderCurrentDir()
